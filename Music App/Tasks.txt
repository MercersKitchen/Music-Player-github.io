Overview

Structured: 
- How does AI Build the sections below
- What are the differences in my code
- Comments on what my code does differently
  How my code prepares for future code (which I already know) 

Graded Sections, split my code into smaller subprograms
- DATE TBA: Adding a Library & Playing a Song or Sound Effect
- DATE TBA: Music Function Key Board Short Cuts for one song or multiple songs
- DATE TBA: DIVs that matches your Case Study
- DATE TBA: 2D Images inside your DIVs
- DATE TBA: Buttons (especially the Quit & Play Button)
- DATE TBA: Images using Aspect Ratio
- DATE TBA: Text using experimental font aspect ratio
- DATE TBA: Text from MP3 File

Procedural: create procedural sections 
- Note: what are subprograms, how does it work, what are the variables

Object Orientated: building a class
