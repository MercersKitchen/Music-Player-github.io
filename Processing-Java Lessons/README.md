Next Note
- Starter Code v Exmeplars: Learning to Code the hardway (short cuts, decreasing typing errors, and using debuggers)
    - the beginning of comprehension
    - what do we learn when we type partial functions, algorithms, etc
    - how does this affect our comprension
    - programs with comments to provide vocabulary and ways to talk about coding (also see curriculume)
    - using ReadMe.md or ReadMe.txt
    - Summary v narrative: art of story telling and creating multiple course-long narratives for engagement and comprehension (talk other humans or AI)
- HelloWorld: time honoured tradition, something bigger than yourself
