Develop all math-based algorithms & grade-level fluency

Note: any computer app end-user experinece is made up of images, shapes, and text

Purpose: build an app to run on any computer or any device
- My lessons limit this to any computer (Mac, Windows) and Android

WARNING: using devices mean enabling developer-mode to side-load programs

Build the Case Study
- Music Functions and Representation
- Colours and style
- Buttons and Placement

Develop the for msuic functions and representation: what does the computer know how to do v. what do you want it to do
- introduce library functions
- how can these be combined into functions
- explore music players, what are the functions 
- how do these features match symbols look like
- answer is minimalism and choice
- answer what is user expereince

Attending to the code, what the voice is at each level
- Structured: one images, music based text, general music app text, specific music buttons and symbols
  - Advanced: grouping lines of code by function, referenced when needed
- Procedural: Mulitple songs, mulitple images, minimal design for specfic end user expereince,
              menu based music player written as an encapsulated subprogram from a prototyped full version
  - Advanced: on-off type button activation
- Object Orientated: rewriting an encapulated subprogram as a static class incoporated in to a larger project
