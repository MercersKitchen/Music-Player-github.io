Video - Must be executing without issue

Input
Functionality
Output

Syntax Error: debugger errors before runtime errors 

Runtime errors: interfere with continuous execution of program 

Logic Errors: might trigger syntax or runtime, but might only be visually verified 

Algorithm: detailed enough for someone else to write code (not AI)
- Similar to Hackathons
- Alogorithm written in input, processing, & output 
- Sequencing: order of steps (or functions)
- Selcetion: if-singleLine, if-else, if-elseIf-else 
- Selection, advanced not taught: case-break 
- Iternation: repeating steps until an outcome is met 

---

Algorithm: sequnce, selection, iteration 

Arguments, logical operators 
- See ternary operator
- See IF Statements 

Listeners have IF Statements 

Input: data into a program 
- GUI Display 
- Listeners 
- Pong Ball Data 

Event: action that supplies input data 

Program segment: within a procedure, i.e. between {} 

Program Functionality: features and user-interactions 

Purpose: problem being solved or creative interest being pursued 

Selection (intermeidate): try-exception
- use of console to determine unknown exceptions 
- use of elseIf to determine handling of known exceptions (see next & previous buttons)
