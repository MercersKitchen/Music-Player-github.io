Note: how the code of some program features influences the code of other program features
- Natural Language conversations must identify the meta understanding of the entire project (learned by student)
- Difference between prototyping and rewriting code for efficiency
- Difference between using computer tools that are faster than interactions with AI

Progression of Natural Language Conversation
- Learning how to code
- Learning how the code will work 
- Learning about math & algorithms

. Building a boilerplate
  - Static: size, variables for parameters, functions (simplifies coding expectations and visually completes algorithms)
    - Static Programs, very simple prototyping examples
    - Sequential Programming, execution of functions and variable inspection in console
    - CANVAS does not change
    - Can be done in a Dynamic Program if ignoring some lines of code
  - Dynamic Processing-JAVA programs: CANVAS changes like an animation
  - Dynamic adds simple compiler needs, emphasizes how a computer is designed to handle a program
  - Compiler necessary lines of code, including MAIN Program Folder Name, setup() & draw()
  - What are the beginning ways to control a program's CANVAS
    - noLoop()
    - loop()
    - listeners like mouse interactions: mousePressed(), etc. (see documentation)
    - listeners like keyboard interactions: keyPressed(), etc. (see documentation)

Note: it is better to work in a more abstract boilerplate than a blank slate
- Emphasis: ability to locate and use landmarks in code according to function of the boilerplate

. How to play a song, loading a library
  - additional words in a computer language, primary functions, that simplify a programmer's work
  - introductory functions to enable further research in the library

Note: this adds more code to ignore for now
- purpose: split students' attention and task
- able to search for music and ensure it plays as a break from coding (reading & writing algorithms)

. Drawing a rectangle, divisions in a page
  - using primary functions, spelling, and bugs
  - explore use of "debugging IDE section" for pre-compiler errors and console output for post-compiler errors
  - parameters in strongly formatted language
  - Global variable: what a compiler and computer need first in computer architecture (values and registry)

  - What are the different parameters of a function: what does the computer need to function (abstraction of case study)
  - How are variables created, different examples of naming, initializing, and assigning value

. Drawing the different music buttons based on feature, function, and representation.

What are the Advanced Placement requirements

Note: start with 100%, when does mark start to decrease

DIVs are built based on referent measures

Purpose of this player: celebration, promotion
- give to someone to share favorite songs and special messages to that person about the songs, images, or shared memories
- full exploration of setup, keyPressed, application to mousePressed
- introducing draw

Purpose: Review the final project after all prototyping is done
- All print() and println() removed
- Heap Sheets for Variables
  - Beginning: record values
  - Intermediate: summarize what these are
  - Advanced: identify manipulation
- Identify bugs: try to prototype a smaller version of the program
  - background
  - images: placement in DIV, what else is happening in DIV
  - missing 2D images
  - previous button
  - Song name doesn't change
  - Song Bar Position doesn't work
- Identify necessary code needed
  - Hover over
  - Activation or last button pressed
  - Shuffle
  - Random start
- Timing & Big O
  - Basic Timing Code
  - Decreasing lines of code in DIVs

Copy program for students to add comments to
Explain all parts, work in groups, use AI

See Comments for Notes and Activities
- Notes in draw() for Reading and Reviewing Structured Code
- Building Buttons based on QUIT Button

Button Data Structure
- iterating through arrays when the mouse is pressed, released, etc.
- data structure is built in setup()
- how is data structure tracked when building procedures
