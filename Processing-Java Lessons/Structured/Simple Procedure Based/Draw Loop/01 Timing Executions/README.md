# Timer-Two-Examples-Creating-Time
CS20 Review of CS10, Timer App

Example 1: nonreal time
- When the OS consumes the cache, ```void draw(){}``` slows down
- For example, WINDOWS checking WINDOWS Update

Example 2: real-time
- Using the crystal as electricity passes through it (1 millisecond)
- However, there is an insignificant time difference between void setup and void draw

Example 3: real-time using extra code in void draw() {}
- Most accurate measure of time
- Uses IF and Boolean
- extra code in void draw() {} is less than one millisecond
