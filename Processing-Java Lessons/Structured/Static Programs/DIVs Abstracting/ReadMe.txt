Abstraction: Create entire shape based on beginning point

Thus, if point moves, shape is drawn
- Called passing a parameter

Exercise: starting from a point, describe to another how to draw with distances based on width & height

---

Further Abstraction: drawing same shape backwards
- subtraction instead of addition (multiply by -1)

Easing variable initialization
