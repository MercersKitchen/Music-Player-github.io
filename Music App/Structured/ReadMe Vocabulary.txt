Algorithm: detailed enough for someone else to write code (not AI)
- Similar to Hackathons
- Alogorithm written in input, processing, & output 
- Sequencing: order of steps (or functions)
- Selcetion: if-singleLine, if-else, if-elseIf-else 
- Selection, advanced not taught: case-break 
- Iternation: repeating steps until an outcome is met
