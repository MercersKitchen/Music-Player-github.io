Why is Computer Science difficult to learn?
What could make computer scinece fun?

---

Develop all math-based algorithms & grade-level fluency

Note: any computer app end-user experinece is made up of images, shapes, and text

Purpose: build an app to run on any computer or any device
- My lessons limit this to any computer (Mac, Windows) and Android

WARNING: using devices mean enabling developer-mode to side-load programs

What if you could walk up to an AI and create a music player
- an experience giving you conceptual understanding to explore and build any app

What if this experience showed you different parts of a computer
- different cyber security issues
- different ways of coding in a generic language
- algorithms
- maths

Teaching & learning works with everyone else who say "no" as an emotional strategy

Build the Case Study
- Music Functions and Representation
- Colours and style
- Buttons and Placement

Develop the for msuic functions and representation: what does the computer know how to do v. what do you want it to do
- introduce library functions
- how can these be combined into functions
- explore music players, what are the functions 
- how do these features match symbols look like
- answer is minimalism and choice
- answer what is user expereince

Attending to the code, what the voice is at each level
- Structured: one images, music based text, general music app text, specific music buttons and symbols
  - Introductory: DIVs
    - how DIVs can resemble a developer bias and projection
    - how DIVs can resemble the CANVAS and cascading variables as referent measures
    - how cascading DIVs or variables creates a library or function with passed parameters
  - Introductory: flowchart of music features and how they do not interfer with each other
  - Introducotry: use of key board listeners for concrete illustration of case-break decision making (ignoring other code in sequential execution)
    - Intermediate: how key board algorithms can be referenced and accessed for mousePressed
  - Introductory: aspect ratio of images
  - Introductory: aspect ratio of drawn text (as a prototyping of text fonts & emotional white space)
  - Advanced: grouping lines of code by function, referenced when needed
- Procedural: Mulitple songs, mulitple images, minimal design for specfic end user expereince,
              menu based music player written as an encapsulated subprogram from a prototyped full version
  - Intermeidate: grouped lines of code, program reads like an essay
  - Intermediate: reading and writing primitive data into arrays to form FOR & WHILE algorithmic drawing 
  - Intermediate: end-user expereince as grouped music buttons, exploring IF Statmenets and Decisions (not cases & breaks yet)
    - Play-Pause-Stop
    - Loop Once-Infinite
    - Previous (first 10 seconds) - Rewind (preference seconds or percent-of-song) & Double Tap to Preiovus Song
    - Next (first 10 seconds) - Fast Forward (preference seconds or percent-of-song)  & Double Tap to Next Song
  - Advanced: on-off type button activation
- Object Orientated: rewriting an encapulated subprogram as a static class incoporated in to a larger project
