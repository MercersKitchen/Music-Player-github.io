Recommened Programs and Steps to Know about ... front of course to end
- Reminders and Foci, <a href="">tba</a>
     - Students must be able to describe algorithms and update their correctness for less than 100% (and not the failing grade)
- HelloWorld, Time Honoureed Traditon, Static Program Start
- Why Processing-JAVA: ease into mulitple languages & Objects-First (visually-based so not typical object-first)
     - AP CSA Exam
     - Java Libraries
     - Static Class to Driver & Processing-Classes to Pure Java Classes
- Why Static
     - When to Start a Variable: before it is needed, after other variables that create it
     - Order of Functions to create larger algorithm, learn function parameters and options
     - What is being repeated in a static program to learn from it
     - TBA
- Why DIVs
     - DIVs: assigning space of display for specific purposes (overlapping, not overlapping)
          - realizing interaction of Processing-Java IDE and VS-Code with CHAT-GPT4
          - realizing CANVAS function
          - realizing key-variables
          - repeating geometry or changing it
     - Pattern, counting, by 1's, counting by groups of 4 (definition of 1), FOR, Copy Array & FOR-Each (music button group), recursive (procedural) reversing FOR
     - What does my case study look like (not a face), uses symmetry and referent measures based in paperfolding or percent
- DIVs: Static Structured Programming
      - DIV_TwoD_Rect.pde
      - basicDIVs
      - DIVs_a_initialization
      - DIVs_b_FOR_MusicShapes
      - Music Shapes: from paper-folding & fractions to abstracting mutliple lines to initialization & FORs (formulaic consistency and numerical change)
      - Music Shapes must lead to abstracting how the shapes are drawn and abstracted like starting & ending points & functions including to procedural abstractions
- DIVs, arrays (with ERROR checking): separating the DIVs into differnt features for different access
     - Able to combine all the same array or visversa
     - Formulaic Consistency using first-degree, mutliple term, polynomials
     - FOR: compare regular-FOR and FOR-each to compare methods for array structures
- DIVs, Matrix Enrichment: separating population of grid-pattern with using the grid patterns
     - Populate any sized rectangle (or square) matrix using rect() as a guide
     - Procedures declaring VOID or a return-type
     - Notice, choosing which array indices to use when drawing can use Quadractics (zeros or roots) or calculator-based regression
- Music Shapes: starting with STOP, each symbol is desinged meaningfully
     - Static, all symbols
     - From paperfolding fractions
     - Abstracting from paperfolding fractions into initialization, FOR

     - NEXT Programs: basic algorithm, initialization, FOR
     - Move the full program over to the exemplar program
     - Procedural for drawing music shapes - use origional complete porgram for demosntration
     - Recursive for drawing music shapes - use origional complete porgram for demosntration

- Offer to Others as Reading App (words over scan of page as background)
- See Weather App and "Go Outside Notification"


Object Orientated Programming: starting with a Static Class in Processing-JAVA
- Identifying a MAIN Program and using TABs to organize the procedures of Music Player
- DIVs, a reivew of arrays, regular-FOR, and FOR-each (declaration & initialization)
- DIVs, a review of procedural application of first-degree, multiple-term, polynomials for array population (i.e. foreshawdowing a constructor)
- DIVs, recursive application to regular-FOR | FOR-each
- Music Symbols, recursion application

Math to include in music buttons
Procedures beyond single degree polynomials here are an exercise
- rational expressions in financial mathematics for book-keeping - why make something more difficult
- work on fluency
Issues similar to
- High School Polynomial Arithmetic in place-value of elementary two number, 2-digit multiplication
- Derivative of speed graph is distance ???

Structured Programming - static Programs
- Algorithms learded
- ERRORs learned
- Easier language structures to learn static classes easier

Application to CSTA Curriculum from Alberta Curriculum
- English recipe writing (various names)
- Math number and algorithms - 2D-multiplcation to binomial mutliplication
- Why is this sophisication important?

- What are the basic coding sturctures to learn in a lanuage, also connected to hardware

See in the medelbrolt fractal and set as metaphpor for above

When is a variable able to stop


---
JSON: Time to Go Outside, the weather is, 3 hour increments
- Array Algorithm: when does the weather model being used start to fall apart (very complicated predicitive algorithm) 
---

The students current reality is noth their grade-level
- fluency & sophicisticaion or proficiency with fluemcy
- AI levels the ability for less-sophisicated to 'level-up' since we cannot use grade-level as a method of communcation
- Communciation: Scholarships, bursaries, awards, titles, trust been given from others
- What does this feel like in a classroom: what is the max grade when 100% is removed as a leveling agent
     - timelines, issues of 100%
     - what has been completed
     - when did a student exit those spiraled lessons
     - what is the next novel task & concept for sprialing
     - assumption: AI can be used anytime to 'level up' & compensate for all deficiencies (what it means to be an expert) 

Classes: learn concepts to start or learn to start other langauges by prototyping
- Prototype and learn how functions interact ( i.e. textFont() before textWidth() )
- What is static: expectations or object-less execution beyond expectations of individual functions
     - if language is to be used without understanding, just output without regard for ERROR-analysis, then AI is answer
- Static Music, Static Weather ... Incorportated into Pong
- Class designed Pong
- Abstract-classes to write code once code again (static, dynamic boilerplate, FOR, proceudral (void & return), )

- static to dynamic boilerplate and how to access 4-different proceudres to objectivfy a program as a "sequential" line of code
- decreasing variable code thorugh declaration, initialization, WHILE (like draw() ), FOR-regular, FOR-each, Arrays, JSON, Recursive (creating initial objects backwards to the origional)
- grouping blocks of code throught object-output as full blocks (including recursion), sub-blocks for returning values
- ERROR handling & pinpointing the unhandled data point
