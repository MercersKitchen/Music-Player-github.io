# Music Player
Lessons, Revisions, and AI (Artificial Intelligence and Academic Integrity)

**CAUTION:** Repository and Website *UNDER CONSTRUCTION*

The beginning page for all lessons using Processing-Java in MercersKitchen for Teaching (Computer Science).

This repository presumes the use of Artificial Intelligence like Co-Pilot. Programs can be opened with Processing-Java or VS-Code with Co-Pilot included through GitHub.

To an expereinced programmer,
- teaching students to read and write code is like making a program utlimately inefficient first. Currently, students' idiosyncratic mistakes cannot be replicated by Artificial intelligence. A teacher knows these.
- Weakly formatted and Stronly formatted languages are known and "Spelling Counts". Not to someone curious. A teacher reengages this curiousity.

# A Music Player App ... Natural Language Descriptions for AI
- Delivers a Computer and Android Experience negotiation
    - 2D Shapes: introducing Computational Theory with listeners & environments separate from IDEs (algorithms are visually checked as complete)
    - Images: introducing Aspect Ratio, flowcharts, and binary decision-making (algorithms are visually checked)
    - Text: Processing.org (Java) specific difficulties related to Aspect Ratio being drawn in the CANVAS
        - Algorithms are self-checking, students' first introduction to self-checking algorithms, mathematical iteration, and computational speed
    - Music
    - Sound Effects
    - Simulating Program speed with crystal oscillation (introduction to computer architecture & code influence)
- This forms a basis for all other

Preumptions
- Human thought requires experience for evaluation of performance 
- Human thought requires human comprehension
- Students are able to use AI to further their own thought

Partial Solution: specific algorithms allow for other algorithms

For algorithmic teaching and learning, Processing.org IDE will be used.
- GitHub and VSCode with Co-Pilot is able to be used as
- Research Tool
- Find and Replace
- Code interpretation

Next Note
- Starter Code v Exmeplars: Learning to Code the hardway (short cuts, decreasing typing errors, and using debuggers)
    - the beginning of comprehension
    - what do we learn when we type partial functions, algorithms, etc
    - how does this affect our comprension
    - programs with comments to provide vocabulary and ways to talk about coding (also see curriculume)
    - using ReadMe.md or ReadMe.txt
    - Summary v narrative: art of story telling and creating multiple course-long narratives for engagement and comprehension (talk other humans or AI)
- HelloWorld: time honoured tradition, something bigger than yourself

# Folder Order
- Lesson Starters: basic code & vocabulary for natural language conversation
- Exemplars: what my purpose is in a lesson
- "Learning to Code the Hardway"

1. Hello World ... a time honoured tradition in static mode
. BoilerPlate ... a basic program template in dynamic mode, introducing comments, psuedocode, and AI completion
. DIV ... introducing geometries, rect(), debugger, parameters, ratios (paperfolding fractions, percents, etc.)
    - Structured: visually verified alogrithm
    - Structured: object introduction
. DIV_Start ... typing for debugger & compiler runtime error control (sometimes on purpose for completion emphasis)
. Logical Button Reprentations: Two-Dimensional Images for Music Buttons ... introduce inscribing shapes within DIVs ( ```rect()``` ), cascading variables from display geomtery (landscape, portrait, & square)
    - rectangle to square inscribing, using paper-folding
    - ternary operators for variable assignment (binary algorithms)
    - IF-Else statements
. Images: using DIVs to draw images the CANVAS
    - Aspect Ratio Algorithm: common sense image resizing or resampling, visually-verified, considers combinations of geometry and locigal consequences
    - Background images: aspect taken from display geometry
    - Filling DIV like a background, same as above
    - Using Aspect Ratio of an image to resize, resample

AI is an amazing research tool
- how do you interact with it and learn from it

Building a conceptual understanding from examples

Builidng a fluency with AI
- creating prompts
