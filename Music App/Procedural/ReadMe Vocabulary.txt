Video - Must be functioning

Describe a procedure, passing parameters is not necessary

---

--- 

To Include

Video - Must be executing without issue

Input
Functionality
Output

List 
- must be more than one element 


Selection & Iteration 
- do not need to be in same algorithm 
- do not need to be in a procedure 
- must affect output of program 

WR#1:  
- IDs user 
- Design must idenitfy needs of user 

WR#2a
- ID Iteration & number of times (FOR ending in known)
- ID Iternation's number of executions 
- ID condition or errror cuasing infinite loop (if not possible, explanin a modification to create an infinite loop)
- Iternation does not need to be in procedure
- If mutliple iterations used in Personal Reference and WR#2a, use the first one

WR#2b
- ID and explain a change to procedure causing a run-time error
- If mutliple procedures are used in PPR, use first one 

WR#2c 
- Data and Procedural Abstraction to determine isEqual
- Uses isEqual (counts the number of elements in a list equal to a certain value)
- Use first list in PPR 
- explain in detailed steps isEqual algorithm (in code, psudeocode, sequence of phrases, or paragraph)
- Algorithm must be detailed enough for someone else to write it
    - iterate over list 
    - running count of list elements equaling a certain value 
    - return the variable or display it
