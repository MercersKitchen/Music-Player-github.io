# Vocabulary to be used in Videos
= Structured Programming, strongly formatted language: naitve processing-java, minim library
- Procedural Programming (CS20): procedures (void & return), minim library, java.io.file library
- Object Oriented Programming (CS30)

Recommened Programs and Steps to Know about ... front of course to end
- Reminders and Foci, <a href="">tba</a>
     - Students must be able to describe algorithms and update their correctness for less than 100% (and not the failing grade)
- Why DIVs
     - DIVs: assigning space of display for specific purposes (overlapping, not overlapping)
          - realizing interaction of Processing-Java IDE and VS-Code with CHAT-GPT4
          - realizing CANVAS function
          - realizing key-variables
          - repeating geometry or changing it
     - Pattern, counting, by 1's, counting by groups of 4 (definition of 1), FOR, Copy Array & FOR-Each (music button group), recursive (procedural) reversing FOR
     - What does my case study look like (not a face), uses symmetry and referent measures based in paperfolding or percent

Math to include in music buttons
Procedures beyond single degree polynomials here are an exercise
- rational expressions in financial mathematics for book-keeping - why make something more difficult
- work on fluency
Issues similar to
- High School Polynomial Arithmetic in place-value of elementary two number, 2-digit multiplication
- Derivative of speed graph is distance ???

     NEXT Music Symbols ONLY in Music Button DIVs



- Object Orientated Programming
     - Recursion based on Static DIVs Program, replicating FOR & known iterations from static program, <a href="">tba</a>
     - NOTE: Enrichment of Any Matrix using Recursion, extension of NESTED Regular FOR

Next Note
- Starter Code v Exmeplars: Learning to Code the hardway (short cuts, decreasing typing errors, and using debuggers)
    - the beginning of comprehension
    - what do we learn when we type partial functions, algorithms, etc
    - how does this affect our comprension
    - programs with comments to provide vocabulary and ways to talk about coding (also see curriculume)
    - using ReadMe.md or ReadMe.txt
    - Summary v narrative: art of story telling and creating multiple course-long narratives for engagement and comprehension (talk other humans or AI)
- HelloWorld: time honoured tradition, something bigger than yourself
