Note: how the code of some program features influcnes the code of other program features
- Natural Language conversations must identify the meta understanding of the entire project (learned by student)
- Difference between prototyping and rewriting code for efficiency
- Difference between using computer tools that are faster than interactions with AI

Progression of Natural Language Conversation

. How to play a Song, loading a library
  - additional words in a computer langauge, primary functions, that simplfy a programmers work
  - introductory functions to enable further research in the library

. Drawing a Rectangle, Divisions in a Page
  - using primary functions, spelling, and bugs
  - parameters in strongly formatted language
  - Global Variable: what a compiler and computer needs first in computer architeure (values and registry)

  - What are the different parameters of a fucntion: what does the comptuer need to function (abstraction of case study)
  - How are variables created, different examples of naming, initializing, and initializing (assigning value)
  

2. Drawing 




What is the Advanced Placement Requirements

Note: start with 100%, when does mark start to decrease

DIVs are built based on referent measures

Purpose of this player: celebration, promotion
- give to someone to share favorite songs and special messages to that person about the songs, images or shared memories
- full exploration of setup, keypressed, application to mousepressed
- introducing draw

Purpose: Review the a final project after all prototyping done
- All print() and println() removed
- Heap Sheets for Variables
  - Beginning: record values
  - Intermediate: summarize what these are
  - Advanced: identify maniuplation
- Identify bugs: try to prototype smaller version of program
  - background
  - images: placement in DIV, what else is happening in div
  - missing 2D images
  - previous button
  - Song name doesn't change
  - Song Bar Position doesn't work
- Identify necessary needed code
  - Hoverover
  - Activation or last button pressed
  - Shuffle
  - Random start
- Timing & Big O
  - Basic Timing Code
  - Decreasing lines of Code in DIVs

Copy program to be students to add comments to
Explain all parts, work in groups, use AI

- Building Buttons based on QUIT Button

Button Data Structure
- iterating through arrays when the mouse is pressed, released, etc.
- data structure is built in setup()
- how is data structure tracked when building procedures
