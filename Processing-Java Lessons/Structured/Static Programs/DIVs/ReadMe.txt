Evaluate patterns in grouped code

Prmitive, non-array values, allows names to recognize patterns between formulae

Each rect() has 4-parameters ... skip-counting by 4, modulus 4
  - #/4 is numbered rectangle
  - #%4 is parameter number or order

If each primitive variable was a number from 1 - 19(4)=76
- computer could count through all numbers
- copy arrays to get subsections for use in other areas
