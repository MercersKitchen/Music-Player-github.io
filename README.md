# A Music Player App ... Natural Language Descriptions for AI
- Delivers a Computer and Android Experience negotiation
    - 2D Shapes: introducing Computational Theory with listeners & environments separate from IDEs (algorithms are visually checked as complete)
    - Images: introducing Aspect Ratio, flowcharts, and binary decision-making (algorithms are visually checked)
    - Text: Processing.org (Java) specific difficulties related to Aspect Ratio being drawn in the CANVAS
        - Algorithms are self-checking, students' first introduction to self-checking algorithms, mathematical iteration, and computational speed
    - Music
    - Sound Effects
    - Simulating Program speed with crystal oscillation (introduction to computer architecture & code influence)
- This forms a basis for all other
