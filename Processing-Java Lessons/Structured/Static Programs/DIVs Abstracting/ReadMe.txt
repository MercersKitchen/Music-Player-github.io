Abstraction: Create entire shape based on beginning point
- All buttons based on STOP Button
- Start in Top Left | Top Right

Thus, if point moves, shape is drawn
- Called passing a parameter

Exercise: starting from a point, describe to another how to draw with distances based on width & height

---

Further Abstraction, procedure: drawing same shape backwards
- subtraction instead of addition (multiply by -1)
- including a term is x1
- excluding a term is x0

- one formula to send parameters to

leftButtonStartX = DivX + subtract*DivWidth*1/4
rightButtonstartX = DivX + subtract*DivWidth*1/4 + include*DivWidth*2/4

Develop one formulae for all examples: procedure

Drawing a Triangle
