# Music Player
Lessons, Revisions, and AI (Artificial Intelligence and Academic Integrity)

**CAUTION:** Repository and Website *UNDER CONSTRUCTION*

The beginning page for all lessons in MercersKitchen for Teaching Computer Science.

This repository presumes the use of Artificial Intelligence like Co-Pilot.

# A Music Player App ... Natural Language Descriptions for AI
- Delivers a Computer and Android Experience negotiation
    - 2D Shapes: introducing Computational Theory with listeners & environments separate from IDEs (algorithms are visually checked as complete)
    - Images: introducing Aspect Ratio, flowcharts, and binary decision-making (algorithms are visually checked)
    - Text: Processing.org (Java) specific difficulties related to Aspect Ratio being drawn in the CANVAS
        - Algorithms are self-checking, students' first introduction to self-checking algorithms, mathematical iteration, and computational speed
    - Music
    - Sound Effects
    - Simulating Program speed with crystal oscillation (introduction to computer architecture & code influence)
- This forms a basis for all other

Preumptions
- Human thought requires experience for evaluation of performance 
- Human thought requires human comprehension
- Students are able to use AI to further their own thought

Partial Solution: specific algorithms allow for other algorithms

For algorithmic teaching and learning, Processing.org IDE will be used.
- GitHub and VSCode with Co-Pilot is able to be used as
- Research Tool
- Find and Replace
- Code interpretation

Next Note
- Starter Code v Exmeplars: Learning to Code the hardway (short cuts, decreasing typing errors, and using debuggers)
    - the beginning of comprehension
    - what do we learn when we type partial functions, algorithms, etc
    - how does this affect our comprension
    - programs with comments to provide vocabulary and ways to talk about coding (also see curriculume)
    - using ReadMe.md or ReadMe.txt
    - Summary v narrative: art of story telling and creating multiple course-long narratives for engagement and comprehension (talk other humans or AI)
- HelloWorld: time honoured tradition, something bigger than yourself
