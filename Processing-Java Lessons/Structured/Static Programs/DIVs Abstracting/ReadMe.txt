Abstraction: Create entire shape based on beginning point
- All buttons based on STOP Button
- Start in Top Left | Top Right

Thus, if point moves, shape is drawn
- Called passing a parameter

Exercise: starting from a point, describe to another how to draw with distances based on width & height

FOR Loop for DIVs: one array each for X, Y, Width, Height
** Reading mousePressed()  - iterate through setting Boolean for 
- FOR-Each reading of same values

One formulae for Procedure to send parameters to .. design of parameters helps to understand how formula works


Ideas
Further Abstraction, procedure: drawing same shape backwards
- subtraction instead of addition (multiply by -1)
- including a term is x1 (parameter declared as param, then initialed with single-If
  - declare
  - if includeParam =0 then 0
  - else If includeParam =1 then 1
  - else catch all for parameter error

- excluding a term is x0

- one formula to send parameters to

leftButtonStartX = DivX + subtract*DivWidth*1/4
rightButtonstartX = DivX + subtract*DivWidth*1/4 + include*DivWidth*2/4

Develop one formulae for all examples: procedure
